## 🚀 What is CS50x?

[CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) is Harvard University’s legendary introduction to computer science and the art of programming. 
Whether you're a complete beginner or someone with some experience, this course is designed to make you think computationally and solve problems efficiently. 

It's not just about learning one programming language; it’s about mastering the fundamentals that will make you a versatile programmer. 
You’ll start with C, a powerful but traditional language, and then move on to Python, SQL, and even web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how computers work, how to write clean and efficient code, and how to tackle real-world problems with confidence.

## 🤓 Why Am I Doing This?

After graduating as a full-stack developer, I realized I wanted to deepen my understanding of how programming really works. 
My year at [Arnia](https://arnia.com.br/) was fantastic for mastering the tools of the trade, but I felt like I needed to dive deeper into the core concepts. 

When I discovered CS50x, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to fill that gap. 
[David Malan’s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malan/) teaching style is phenomenal, and I highly recommend this course to anyone who’s serious about becoming a better programmer.

## 🗓️ Course Schedule

Here's a quick overview of what you'll be diving into:
